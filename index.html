                    <h3>🌾 Agricultural Heritage</h3>
                    <p>Rice farming has been the cornerstone of Khmer life for over a thousand years. Traditional farmers developed sophisticated irrigation systems and followed lunar calendars to determine planting seasons.</p>
                    <p>Water buffalo were essential partners in farming, helping to plow fields and transport goods. The relationship between farmers and their animals was one of mutual respect and care.</p>
                    <div class="extra-content">
                        <p><strong>Traditional Farming Techniques:</strong> Khmer farmers used a technique called "transplanting" where rice seedlings were grown in nurseries before being moved to flooded fields. This method increased yields and allowed for better crop management.</p>
                        <p><strong>Seasonal Festivals:</strong> The farming calendar was marked by ceremonies like Pithi Chrat Preah Nengkal (Royal Plowing Ceremony) to ensure good harvests.</p>

                    <h3>🏠 Traditional Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Khmer houses were traditionally built on stilts to protect against flooding during monsoon seasons. These elevated homes were constructed using natural materials like bamboo, wood, and palm leaves.</p>
                    <p>The space beneath houses served multiple purposes: storing tools, sheltering animals, and providing a cool gathering place during hot days.</p>
                    <div class="extra-content">
                        <p><strong>Construction Wisdom:</strong> Houses were oriented to catch prevailing winds for natural cooling. The steep-pitched roofs efficiently shed monsoon rains.</p>
                        <p><strong>Community Building:</strong> Entire villages would come together to help build houses, strengthening social bonds through collective effort.</p>
